# Pokemon Demo Game
Small android application that implements google maps and uses icons
of Pokemons and Mario for location markers. If you move within 10 
meters of a pokemon then it will be captured. To be able to build and
use this app, you need to provide your own Google Developer API Key.
You need to create a file named dev_secret.properties in the app directory
and provide the Map Key in  `MAPS_API_KEY=`.

Created with Android Studio following the course: 
[The Complete Android Kotlin Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaoBUAdcl9XRw==/)

## Modifications
The game logic has been modified from what is shown in the course, taking advantage of Kotlin's 
advances since the course was released and personal refactoring of the code itself.
